# crispy-fortnight
Custom Python 2.7 Remote Access Terminal (RAT) built just for fun. The intent is to understand the "inner-workings" of RAT's and improve detection of malicious behavior. Features are added for purely educational learning, NOT for malicious activity! You are responsible for your own actions.
